Dockerfile to create a container for raspberry pi
Sends the CPUcore temperature and LiPo battery data of a Pine A64 via MQTT to a broker every minute
(to be used in OpenHAB for example)

create environment file containing:
MQTTBROKER=<hostname of your broker>
MQTTPORT=1883
MQTTBASE=<MQTT Base Path>
MQTTPARAMETER=<other Parameters or empty>

start with:
docker run -d --restart=unless-stopped --name pinea64-mqtt-cpulipo -h <container-hostname> --env-file <path-to-env-file> intrepidde/pinea64-mqtt-cpulipo:1.1
or
docker run -d --restart=unless-stopped --name pinea64-mqtt-cpulipo --uts="host" --env-file <path-to-env-file> intrepidde/pinea64-mqtt-cpulipo:1.1

Add "-v <local path>:<container path>" to command line (example: "-v /etc/ssl/certs:/etc/ssl/certs" without quotation),
in env file MQTTPARAMETER=--cafile /etc/ssl/certs/<your ca-file> --tls-version tlsv1.1
and change port to 8883

based on: armhf/alpine:3.4 using mosquitto_pub
